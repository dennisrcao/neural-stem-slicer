## TODO List
- Ableton segmentation BPM identification: maybe we need to write the metadata into the segmented loops 
- Onset detection of the "1" beat
- Type check for manual override must be a number BPM and a camelot wheel string 
- Total Processing Time: 314.87 seconds

## Development Setup
### Reset Environment
If you need to reset your development environment:
```bash
# Deactivate current environment if active
deactivate
# Remove existing environment
rm -rf .venv
rm -rf output/  # Remove any test outputs
# Create fresh environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv

# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Reinstall models
python step3_0_Seperation_Models/drumsep/drumsepInstall.py

# Make executable (macOS/Linux only)
chmod +x step3_0_Seperation_Models/drumsep/drumsep
```
